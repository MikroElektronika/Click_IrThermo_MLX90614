IrThermo Click features MLX90614ESF-AAA single zone Infrared Thermometer module capable 
of non-contact temperature measurements.It is calibrated in wide temperature ranges: -40 
to 85°C for the ambient temperature and -70 to +380°C for the object temperature (-20 to 120°C in PWM mode). 
IrThermo Click™ communicates with target board microcontroller via mikroBUS™ I2C lines (SCL, SDA) or PWM line. 
These features make this board ideal for automotive, industrial temperature control, movement detection, air 
conditioning control and more. The board is designed to use 5V power supply only.
